# Molecular_dynamics

This code simulates the dynamics of charged particles interacting with the Coulomb potential. Half of the particles are positively charged and the other half is negatively charged so that there is an attraction between some of the particles while others experience a repulsive force. Since in that case the energy of the Coulomb potential is not bounded from below (i.e. can take negative values), a short range repulsive potential of the form *a*/*r*^2 is added to regularize the problem. The system shows different behaviours when the parameter *a* is varied. One can also change the temperature in the file **md_constEnergy.m** to change between solid, liquid and gas phase. Run **md_constEnergy.m** to study the different behaviours.
